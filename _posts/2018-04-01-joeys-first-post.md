  Greetings readers to my first blog post! My name is Joseph Mullica however I've always gone by Joey. I am an aspiring Web Developer who has the basic fundamentals of HTML and CSS down already. JavaScript is still on the chopping block to learn more about as well as hosting which leads us here. I accidentally stumbled across [Jekyll][jekyll-hp] through [codecademy][codecademy] and decided to delve a little further into it. This leads us here to my blog site, which at the time of posting this, currently being hosted through github pages. 

  Essentially this blog is going to be a series detailing my learning path of Web Development. I plan on eventually going into more depth about future endeavors with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As of right now due to my own ignorance I cant exactly say what I'll be discussing in detail because I'm still learning myself so don't really know what I'll be learning. The point is though, as I learn it, I'll discuss it! I can say though my next post will go into more detail about Jekyll and getting this initial site running!
